Portfolio site containing details on projects I have made over the past years from the plagiarism checker I made during my first year at university to the [discord bot](https://github.com/Michael-Perdue/Discord-Helper-Bot) I made in the summer of 2023. It also contains my CV and a little bit about my background.
