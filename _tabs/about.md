# Education 
## MSci. Software Engineering with Industrial Experience (2020 – Present) Lancaster University

Scheduled to graduate with a First-Class MSci degree in July of 2024.   

#### Java projects     
- Created a plagiarism checker in Java with Swing which can check one text document with any
number of other given text documents.
- Made a solar system model in Swing where you can add and remove planets and moons.
- A recursive depth first search, shortest path maze solving algorithm.
- I have made a passive replication system for an auction house using java RMI.  

#### Python projects     
- I have delved into computer networks in Python and made a raw implementation of ICMP Pings,
Traceroutes (UDP and ICMP), Web server and proxy server.
- Using the cryptography module, I programmed the Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, symmetric and
asymmetric encryption and hashing.   

#### C projects
- In C I have created my own implementation of Malloc and Free which has helped me gain a broader
knowledge of memory management.    

#### Second year group project C#    
- We created a top-down beat-em-up style game in C# based around the Lancaster University campus.
- As part of the project, I created an A* pathing algorithm.
- Group work taught me about using version control (pull requests, code reviews etc.) with GitHub, to
efficiently work on a coding project in a group.   

#### Third year project - full stack development (C++, Java, Python rest API, SQL, HTML, JavaScript)
- During my third year I have been working on the full stack of a group project involving Micro:bits and
creating a live distributed system.
- The system lets the user via our website configure a smart environment spanning multiple buildings,
that reports the temperature, light, noise and location of people throughout the buildings, control
the lights remotely and lets Micro:Bits act as an ID to open doors.
- The system can work for any domain and is fully manageable from the front-end website which is
hosted on a VPS.
- I was involved in embedded coding of the Micro:bits in C++ which we setup to communicate via
radio in mesh network and one Micro:bit serially writes the messages to a java program.
- Another one of my roles was the java program which was designed in an observer pattern to process
different serial packets, then calling the API to store it in the database and write responses to serial. I
also created Twitter and Facebook bots which periodically sends out, posts regarding readings.
- In earlier iterations I learned and used google protocol buffers to create and pass messages.
- Created and managed a MySQL database and an Influx database.
- In python I wrote a REST API using flask which has user verification and writes to a MySQL database
using SQL statements and an influx database which was achieved through flux statements.
- I created the graph page for the website by using the graphs from Grafana.
- For testing purposes, I setup java and python unit tests, setup Grafana to view the live data in the
influx database, performed extensive integration and user testing.
