## Education
### Software Engineering MSci Hons 2020 – Present Lancaster University

Third year of studying Software Engineering MSci Hons at Lancaster University working at a projected 1st.

So far whilst studying at Lancaster I have created a plagiarism checker in Java which can check one text document with any number of other given text documents. Furthermore, in Java I have also created a solar system model and a recursive depth first search, shortest path maze solving algorithm. I have also created a passive replication system for an auction house using java RMI.

I have delved into computer networks in Python and made a raw implementation of ICMP Pings, Traceroutes (UDP and ICMP), Web server and proxy server. In C I have created my own implementation of Malloc and Free which has helped me gain a broader knowledge of memory management.
Furthermore, group work has taught me about GitHub and using version control to efficiently work on a coding project in a group. During my group work, we created a top-down beat-em-up style game in C# based around the Lancaster University campus, as part of the project I created an A* pathing algorithm.

Third year projects: 
During my third year I have been working on group projects involving Micro:bits and live distributed systems. Two systems have been made one which is a smart lab that lets you get the temperature, light, noise and location of people throughout the room. This works through Micro:bits communicating via radio and then one Micro:bit is plugged into a computer and serially it writes messages to a program that processes it and sends it to a database. This database is then accessed by an API which gives data to a website. 

The second system I worked on is an extension of the first and works through the whole of campus now also tracking peoples movement throughout campus, the amount of people in buildings and letting people user their Micro:bits as IDs to unlock doors. The database is now only communicated through the API as in production you wouldn’t be able to always have a direct connection to the database. The second system was made to be extensible and can work for any domain and is fully manageable from the front-end website which is hosted on a VPS along with most of the other components to allow the system to be accessible from wherever.

For these two third year projects I have used C++ to code the Micro:bits, google protocol buffers to create and pass messages, in Java processed data serially, in an event driven way, created unit tests, used Twitter and Facebook APIs to schedule regular posts and managed a MySQL database. In python wrote a rest API using flask and wrote to a MySQL database using SQL statements and an influx database which was achieved through flux statements. Finally for testing purposes used Grafana to view the live data in the influx database.
