**Project Overview:**

For this project, I used **Java** with **Swing** to create a Plagiarism Checker. It's a handy tool with three key functions designed to make text analysis easy. It loads the text files from a specific folder making it so you could in theory compare infinite amount of files.

## Text Window: Highlight Similarities

In the Text Window, you can compare two text files by entering their full names (like `test1.txt`). Just set a minimum word count for a phrase, and it shows both files side by side, highlighting where phrases match.

## Word Frequency Window: Explore/Find Word Usage

The Word Frequency Window offers two useful features. On the left, enter two text file names to compare word usage. It lists words in descending order from the first file. On the right, input a word, and it shows how often it appears in all the files.

## Overall Percentage Plagiarised Window: Assess Plagiarism

The Overall Percentage Plagiarised Window has more insights. On the left, set a minimum word count for phrases. It displays the top 10 files with the highest percentages of plagiarised content, based on shared phrases. On the right, specify a minimum word count and enter a filename for comparison. It generates a report, showing files in descending order and comparing the selected file to all others.

**Closing Thoughts:**

This project not only demonstrates my early Java skills but also showcases my creation of user-friendly software. I developed it during my first year at university and shows my start in coding in Java and making graphical user interfaces.
